# Handoff — server-side backend work

**Disposable working note.** A Claude Code session running ON THE SERVER
(`/var/www/www.raftabul.com/test`, bare-metal PHP 8.3, PostgreSQL/Redis, **no
Docker**) reads this to pick up backend work the desktop (frontend) session
queued. You are autonomous here: run the suite yourself, fix root causes, commit
each fix separately, push.

The frontend is already built against every contract below and **degrades
cleanly until the backend lands** — nothing breaks in production while this is
pending.

## ▶ ACTIVE work order

_None._ `BUILD_LISTING_FILTERS.md` (ADR-080) **landed 2026-08-14** — commit
`1acc4a9`, verified live on `/cilt-bakimi`: 1,138 products, 40-brand facet, price
span ₺31.85–₺9,576.00; picking a brand + ₺100–₺500 narrowed the grid to 6 while
the facets stayed whole. Timings 0.19s / 0.22s.

Queue the next one here.

## How to work (autonomous)

- **Run the suite yourself**: `php artisan test`. The Pest suite runs against
  sqlite `:memory:` (phpunit.xml) — it does NOT touch the app's Postgres, so
  schema works on both paths. Edits and tests are the same filesystem; no git
  round-trip needed. Commit each fix (small, one root cause per commit) and push.
- To see the real exception behind a 500 (Pest hides it):
  `php artisan test --filter="<part of test name>" 2>&1 | tail -50`, or
  `grep -iE "Exception:|Attempted to lazy load|not retrieved" storage/logs/laravel.log`.

## Binding rules (do not violate)

1. **Execution-driven only.** Fix a failure only after you have SEEN it fail and
   read its real exception. No speculative refactors; do not refactor working code.
2. **Sprint/work-order never overrides docs** (ADR-018). If `BUILD_LISTING_FILTERS.md`
   contradicts the ADR chain, STOP and report — don't pick a side silently.
3. **NEVER edit `tests/Feature/Auth/GuardIsolationTest.php` to make it pass** — a
   failure there is a privilege-escalation bug; fix the code (CLAUDE.md).
4. **Frozen modules** (Identity v2.0, Organization v1.0, Store v1.0): only
   bug/security/compat fixes. Catalog/Offer are NOT frozen — this work touches
   the browse read path + `OfferQueryContract`, which is fair game.
5. **Boundary is enforced by tests, not convention.** `LayeringTest` +
   `CatalogBoundaryTest` fail the build on a leak. Price/stock stays out of
   Catalog; Catalog reads Offer only through the Core contract.
6. **Strict mode is ON in tests** (`Model::shouldBeStrict`): lazy-load /
   missing-attribute throws in tests but only logs in production. Declare eager
   loads on the repository `$with`, not at the call site. A test only catches
   lazy-load with TWO+ rows.

## History

First integration (test-suite green-up) is **COMPLETE** — suite green
(357 passed / 0 failed). That earlier handoff content has been retired; this file
now tracks the current pending work order above.
